# WordHunts

A solver and generator for word hunt puzzles

## hunter.py

Run this file to solve word hunts.

When you see the "> " prompt, enter a line from the

word hunt and click Enter. Once you have entered each

line, press Enter again. It will now prompt you with

"Find word: ". Enter a word to find and it will show

you the position of the first letter. (You can take it

from there)

Sometimes it will not tell you where a word is until

you spell the word backwards. I don't know why.
